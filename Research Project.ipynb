    "To earn an A in the class, you must research a new topic in analytics, find data in Kaggle (or another source) that is relevant, and then write up a memo that describes the topic, your research, your analysis, and your findings.  Although you may use a topic from the Udemy class, **you may not use any of the data that Frank uses in the Udemy class. You must find your own data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Students who want to do this project must have their topic approved by me before Monday, November 2nd.  Your analysis approach must use one of the following:\n",
    "* Support Vector Machines (SVMs)\n",
    "* Logistic Regression\n",
    "* Naive Bayes\n",
    "* K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that **you** must be the driving force behind this project--not me.  That motivation is what will merit an A in the course.   The research project is due the final week of class. "
