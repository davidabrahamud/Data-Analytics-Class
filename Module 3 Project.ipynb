    "In our regression model our focus is to find out which variable best predicts the selling price of a car. In our data set we included the variables Engine Size, MPG, seats, Year Index, type of fuel, what number owner the car belongs to, milage on the car, transmission, and horsepower. After running our model, we came up with Figure 1. Since our probability F statistic is lower than 0.05, we have a linear model. Our R squared is significant being that the value is 0.696 meaning about 70% of our data is being explained by the predictions the model came up with. The deviation between R squared and Adj R squared can be an indication of model overfit. In the case of our model the difference between to 2 is only 0.01 telling us we do not suffer from model overfit. The average error in our predictions is 1992.99 which is bad considering the mean for selling price is only 6275 dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our original regression model, the y-intercept is the \"constant\" our model produced which is -30,810. This number looks weird but selling a car with no engine, no seats, no miles, and built in 1950 is super unrealistic so this is a logical y-int. Seats in our model was given a coefficient of 164.57, every seat in the car adds on average 165 dollars in value. MPG was given a coefficient of -1.39, this is the opposite of intuition, adding MPG should add value to a car. Our model gives us a P>|t| of 0.470 for MPG, typically any P>/t/ value over 0.05 renders the variable insignificant. Wondering why this is Figure 5 explains that seats and engine size correlates with MPG (more seats & more engine makes for a heavier car) this could be why it is insignificant. Engine Size was given a coefficient of 0.79 meaning for each CC bigger your engine is adding 80 cents in value on average, which seems logical considering each engine over 600 CC. For each unit of Horsepower 52.17 dollars of value is added to the car. Miles gives us a negative beta coefficient of 0.007 which means the car depreciates about 1 cent for every mile the car is driven. An automatic transmission will add on average 1023.13 of cost compared to a manual transmission. Being the first owner of your car adds 559.16 of value to the car, answering the question if first time owners pay more for the same exact car as 2nd, 3rd, etc. every extra owner depreciates the value of the car. Another interesting point is that if the same car is sold to you from a dealer compared to an Individual seller this increases the value as well, by approximately 397.28. Another question asked was if a car that runs on diesel fuel is worth more money. Diesel was given a coefficient of 1141.24, meaning yes, they are worth more. This could raise the thought that diesel cars are worth more because intuition tells you they will have higher engine size and horsepower. In figure 5 we test the multicollinearity of our predictor variables and find that Horsepower and Engine Size do correlate well with cars running on diesel fuel. For the year index we come up with a coefficient of 471.05, for every year newer the car is approximately 471.05 dollars is added to the selling price. Then for our car manufacturer we chose Honda to see if the brand name adds to the cost of the car. A Honda vehicle adds 349.38 in value compared to other makes. All our coefficients retained a P>|t| value under .05, besides MPG, we know they are significant and can keep them in our model. T values are found by dividing our coefficients by the std error, the T values are used to test how strong the coefficient is compared to its error, the higher the better. The goal for our model is to have T values above 2, we reach this for every variable besides MPG.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gauge model overfitting we split our data into a train and a test data set. We used the train dataset to develop the model and then used test dataset to gauge its generalizability. Figure 2 contains the model produced from the Training set; Figure 3 is the Test data. Comparing the train data set to our test a few statistics stood out. MPG remained insignificant for both. The seats coefficient is now 137.61 in train about 100 dollars less than the test data which says seats add 231.50. Our probability F statistic was 0.00 for both. The average error was 1993.10 which is consistent with test average error 1980.79. Our probability F statistic was 0.00 for both. The R squared is slightly better for the test data and the small deviation of 0.02 between R squared and Adj R squared for our test data indicates we do not suffer from model overfit. This makes logical sense, because have 7000+ rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity refers to high correlation among models features but correlation among features reflects duplicate information in the model. We used VIF function from figure 4 to examine our multicollinearity. Features with VIF values over 2 were examined. The features with high VIF values are seats, MPG, Horsepower, Engine Size, Diesel, and Year Index. To confirm our suspicion of multicollinearity we came up with Figure 5 to see if the correlation between features makes logical sense. Features correlating over 0.5 is a cause for concern, it would make sense to remove one of 2 features to decrease our multicollinearity. As suspected in the first paragraph seats correlates with Engine Size which makes sense because if a car has more seats it is most likely heavier and needs more engine power. MPG has a significant inverse correlation with engine size, meaning cars with bigger engines are less fuel efficient. Engine size posts the highest VIF out of all of the features, we have already stated it correlates with seats, and inversely with MPG but it also correlates with Horse power which is very intuitive because a larger engine of course produces more horse power. For that reason, Horsepower also had a VIF over 2. Diesel is the next feature of concern but as stated before this is because of its correlation with engine size and horsepower. Year index has a VIF score of over 2 but this is because its correlation with First Owner.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this analysis of multicollinearity, we decided to remove Engine Size because that was the feature that had the highest VIF and it correlated with most of the features that had issues of multicollinearity. Thus, producing Figure 6 and the ensuing VIF scores on Figure 7. Oddly enough with this new and improved regression model R squared decreased and the average error raised slightly."
