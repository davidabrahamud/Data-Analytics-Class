    "## Question\n",
    "The United States federal personal income tax is calculated based on filing status and taxable income. There are four filing statuses: single filers, married filing jointly, married filing separately, and head of household. The tax rates vary every year. Below are the rates for 2009. If you are, say, single with a taxable income of \\\\$10,000, the first \\\\$8,350 is taxed at 10% and the other \\\\$1,650 is taxed at 15%. So, your tax is \\\\$1,082.50.\n",
